NAME
    CGI::Application::Plugin::Header - Plugin for handling header props.

SYNOPSIS
      package MyApp;
      use parent 'CGI::Application';
      use CGI::Application::Plugin::Header;

      sub do_something {
          my $self = shift;

          my $header = $self->header; # => CGI::Header object

          # get header props.
          my $type = $header->type; # => "text/plain"

          # set header props.
          $header->type("text/html");

          # compatible with the core methods of CGI::Application
          $self->header_props( type => "text/plain" );
          $self->header_add( type => "text/plain" );

          ...
      }

DESCRIPTION
    By using this plugin, your application is capable of the following
    methods, where $cgiapp denotes the instance of your application which
    inherits from CGI::Application:

  ATTRIBUTES
    $header = $cgiapp->header
        Returns a CGI::Header object associated with $cgiapp. You can use
        all methods of $header.

          sub cgiapp_postrun {
              my ( $self, $body_ref ) = @_;
              $self->header->set( 'Content-Length' => length $$body_ref );
          }

        You can also define your "header" class which inherits from
        "CGI::Header":

          use My::CGI::Header;
          my $app = MyApp->new( HEADER => My::CGI::Header->new );

  METHODS
    This plugin overrides the following methods of CGI::Application:

    $cgiapp->header_props
        Behaves like CGI::Application's "header_props" method. Internally,
        this method is reimplemented using $header.

    $cgiapp->header_add
        Behaves like CGI::Application's "header_add" method. Internally,
        this method is reimplemented using $header.

   INCOMPATIBILITY
    Header property names are normalized by $header automatically, and so
    this plugin breaks your code which depends on the return value of
    "header_props":

      my %header_props = $cgiapp->header_props; # => ( -cookies => 'ID=123456' )

      if ( exists $header_props{-cookie} ) {
          ...
      }

    Those codes can be rewritten using $header as well as "header_props" or
    "header_add":

      if ( $cgiapp->header->exists('-cookie') ) {
          ...
      }
